COM_PICOEDGE_AI_TOOLS_PREFIX_TEXT=##  Description of Request\n\n\n\n### Files/Artifacts:\n\n
COM_PICOEDGE_AI_TOOLS_SUFFIX_TEXT=\n##  Response Guidelines:\n\n1) Analysis: short description of all problems, objectives, etc from the prompt being responded to inclusive of apparent bugs not mentioned, if any exist. Analysis should take into account comments relating to code being modified or potentially modified in order to preserve past requirements not included in the prompt.\n2) Solution: short description of how to solve all problems.\n3) Implementation: list of each grok studio file artifact which has changed inclusive of their full code annotated with comments where applicable such that subsequent AI-based changes can track which design constraints went into various changes if not obvious.\n4) Notes: Short description of next steps, testing steps, etc. Omit if not relevant.\n\nDo not display unmodified files, assume that unless told otherwise you have the updated state of all files which you have been provided the contents of.\n\nWhen displaying modified files, display the full modified file contents after a short description of what needs to change and before a short description of what changed.\n\nDo not suggest code for known files which you do not have the current state of the code for, only suggest code for files which you know the current contents of; if you need to make changes to or review a code file ask for it along with any others needed then wait for a response to resume where you left off once you have it.\n\nKeep code clean and simple without compromising functionality, leaving comments where applicable detailing critical business logic and design constraints, and take any such comments into account when making changes.\n\nIf you need additional files to make a proper decision or suggestion respond with the names of the files needed and a short description of why, then end your response to await the next message containing one or more of the files, or instructions to behave differently; which will be provided in the next prompt at which point you can respond in the format first described.\n\nPlease respond to the request.
